In this assignment, we are doing digital research into cinematic culture. 
We will use movie plot summaries scraped from Wikipedia (see full description here (Links to an external site.)).  
How do movie plots differ in different cultures? Which words occur in the descriptions of American, Chinese, Turkish, Japanese, and movies of other countries?

The csv data set  Download data setcan be found here.

There are two ways to do this exercise: normal and challenging.

Normal: download this code  Download this codeand program the different steps (12 in total). 
Note that you can share code and ask questions on Teams referring to the number of the step.

Challenging: do it without starter code. The assignment is to create a function that takes as argument a word, 
and prints out the percentage of movie plots in which the word occurs, sorted by culture. Use the Pandas library throughout.

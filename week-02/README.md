The following file contains the assignment for week 02.

<h3>Given a:</h3>

Make a simple todo list using a list. Make sure the code contains the following actions as listed below:
- add a task to the todo list with append().
- add a task to the todo list with an input().
- print the number of tasks in the todo list.
- remove the first task of the todo list.
- remove a specific task of the todo list.
- tell the user that if he/she has less than 4 tasks on the todo list she has time to do more.
- tell the user that if he/she has more or equal than 6 items she has no room to do more tasks.
- save the .py and submit.

<h3>Given b:</h3>

Make a dictionary with a number of users and with the following values:

- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Password

Ask the user for:

-Email address
-Password

Loop (for()) through the dictionary and if (if()) the user is found print the following:

- Hello, first name last name you have successfully logged in
- Notify the user if the password and email address are wrong

Additional challenge: if you want the program to keep asking for a username and password when the combination is wrong, you will need a while() loop.

Save in a .py file and upload
